### Holding Entry Analysis

A common misnomer in the aviation world is that there is a "protected side" 
when holding either as published or as assigned. The reality is that the area 
on both sides of the holding course is protected. This disqualifies 
"techniques" when entering holding to stay on the "protected side" even under 
strong wind conditions. This code evaluates holding entries based on initial 
course to the holding fix, airspeed, wind speed, and wind direction, showing 
graphically that under adverse conditions, following normal entry procedures as 
outlined in the AIM results in staying inside the protected area as defined in 
the [FAA TERPS][1].
