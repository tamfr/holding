### Holding Entry Analysis

A common misnomer in the aviation world that there is a "protected side" when
holding either as published or as assigned. The reality is that the area on
both sides of the holding course is protected. This disqualifies "techniques"
when entering holding to stay on the "protected side" even under strong wind
conditions. This code evaluates holding entries based on initial course to the
holding fix, airspeed, wind speed, and wind direction, showing graphically that
under adverse conditions, following normal entry procedures as outlined in the
AIM results in staying inside the protected area as defined in the FAA TERPS.
